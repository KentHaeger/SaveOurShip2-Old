	<SoSHibernateWarningStandalone>The drive is ready to begin discharging its stored momentum. Once this is done, your colonists will be able to safely disassemble the drive and retrieve its Entanglement Manifold.\n\nThe process will take about 15 days, and the energy signature will be detectable from a long distance away. This sort of energy signature indicates interstellar flight capability, and will attract gangs of desperate raiders and swarms of deadly mechanoids.\n\nYou will be assaulted with an intensity you've never seen.
